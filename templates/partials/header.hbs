Param callback functions are local to the router on which they are defined. They
are not inherited by mounted apps or routers. Hence, param callbacks defined on
app will be triggered only by route parameters defined on app routes. All param
callbacks will be called before any handler of any route in which the param
occurs, and they will each be called only once in a request-response cycle, even
if the parameter is matched in multiple routes, as shown in the following
examples.
